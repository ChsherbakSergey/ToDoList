# ToDoList

This project aims at the work with UserDefaults and Realm.
In the project the main page was created where user can type their name and lastName and when they close and open the App again it will still be there.
Same work has been done with Realm for creating ToDoList. Now user can add their todos using UIAlertController, put checkmark on the todos that have been done and also delete them.
